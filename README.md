# Boston-Housing-Regression 🏠 📊

Welcome to the Boston-Housing-Regression project! 🎉 This repository contains code and resources for building a regression model to predict housing prices in Boston. 🏡💰

## Overview ℹ️

This project focuses on using machine learning techniques to analyze the Boston Housing dataset and develop a predictive model. 🤖🏘️ The goal is to understand the various factors affecting housing prices and create a model that accurately predicts prices based on these factors. 📈🔍

## Dataset 📂

The dataset used in this project is the Boston Housing dataset, which includes various attributes such as crime rate, nitric oxides concentration, number of rooms, etc., for different suburbs in Boston. 📊🏙️ You can find the dataset in the `data` directory. 📦
